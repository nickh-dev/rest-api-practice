# REST API with Flask hands-on practice
Here I'm practicing REST API + Insomnia app to become strong in this field.
All tasks are taken from Udemy course (REST APIs with Flask and Python in 2023
) --> https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for building web services that use HTTP methods and follow specific conventions to interact with resources (data) on a server. It allows client applications to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources by sending HTTP requests to the server. The server, in turn, responds with the appropriate data or status codes.

Python, in combination with the Flask framework, is a popular choice for building RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and ease of use. Flask is a lightweight web framework that provides the tools and libraries needed to create web applications and APIs.
